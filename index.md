of Complex Systems (DOCS) Group at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>. 
Prior to joining UW, I got my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn/">Wuhan University</a>. 
Currently, my work focuses on the optimization and control of cyber-physical systems.
